This tutorial provides a quick introduction to using Spark. We will first introduce the API through Spark’s interactive shell (in Python or Scala), then show how to write standalone applications in Java, Scala, and Python. See the programming guide for a more complete reference.

To follow along with this guide, first download a packaged release of Spark from the Spark website. Since we won’t be using HDFS, you can download a package for any version of Hadoop.
This first maps a line to an integer value, creating a new RDD. reduce is called on that RDD to find the largest line count. The arguments to map and reduce are Scala function literals (closures), and can use any language feature or Scala/Java library. For example, we can easily call functions declared elsewhere. We’ll use Math.max() function to make this code easier to understand
